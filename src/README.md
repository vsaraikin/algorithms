## Approach to a problem

1. If I cannot solve problem myself in 20 mins, go the hint.
2. If hint did not help in 10 mins, watch solution.
3. Go back the day after and resolve problem.

The majority of the tasks are taken from [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) and [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice)
